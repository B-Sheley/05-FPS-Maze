First Person Red Light Green Light Maze Game 

In this game you will navigate a maze in first person. Collect 3 keys hidden throughout the maze to unlock the exit. Stationed throughout the maze are robot sentries who shine red or green lights. When the light is red you can freely pass the front of the robot, but if the light shines red beware. For you will take damage. If your lives reach 0, you lose. 

## Implementation
Multiple Objects to pick up. (The three keys.)
A somewhat elaborate maze. 
Multiple Enemies who generate the red and green lights using spotlights, and raycasting to detect the player on red light.
Random number generation to change what color each robot starts on, as well as change the intervals between light changes for each robot.
